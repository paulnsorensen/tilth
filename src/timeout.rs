//! Per-request wall-clock timeout wrapper for synchronous tool calls.
//!
//! Rust has no sync-world equivalent of Java's `Future.get(timeout, unit)`, so
//! we spawn a fresh thread per call, wait on a `crossbeam_channel` bounded(1)
//! with `select! { default(timeout) => ... }`, and detach the worker on timeout.
//!
//! Because Rust cannot forcibly cancel a running thread, a timed-out worker
//! keeps running until its `FnOnce` completes naturally. A bounded counter
//! ([`ThreadTracker`]) tracks how many detached workers are still in flight and
//! refuses new work at [`MAX_ABANDONED_THREADS`] to prevent unbounded thread
//! accumulation on pathologically slow operations.
//!
//! It cannot be *forced* to stop, but it can be asked. Each spawn publishes a
//! [`crate::cancel`] token that the tree walks capture as they are built, and
//! the deadline arm sets it, so an abandoned worker's walk prunes itself
//! instead of running to completion. The flag is set **only** inside the
//! branch that has already won `ThreadCoord::claim_timeout` — that CAS is what
//! guarantees the result is discarded, and it is the whole reason a per-file
//! flag check here is safe rather than a source of nondeterminism. `cancel`'s
//! module header states the property in full, including the half a cancel
//! *does* reach: an abandoned worker still renders, so state that outlives
//! the request needs its own guard. `only_the_expired_request_is_cancelled`
//! below pins the two properties this module owns.
//!
//! [`ThreadCoord`] is a `RUNNING` → (`TIMED_OUT` | `FINISHED`) CAS state
//! machine that guarantees the tracker is incremented and decremented exactly
//! once per spawn even when the worker's channel send races the main
//! thread's deadline.
