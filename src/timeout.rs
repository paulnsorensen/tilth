//! Per-request wall-clock timeout wrapper for synchronous tool calls.
//!
//! Rust has no sync-world equivalent of Java's `Future.get(timeout, unit)`, so
//! we spawn a fresh thread per call, wait on a `crossbeam_channel` bounded(1)
//! with `select! { default(timeout) => ... }`, and detach the worker on timeout.
//!
//! Because Rust cannot forcibly cancel a running thread, a timed-out worker
//! keeps running until its `FnOnce` completes naturally. A bounded counter
//! (`ThreadTracker`) tracks how many detached workers are still in flight and
//! refuses new work at [`MAX_ABANDONED_THREADS`] to prevent unbounded thread
//! accumulation on pathologically slow operations.
//!
//! [`ThreadCoord`] is a `RUNNING` → (`TIMED_OUT` | `FINISHED`) CAS state
//! machine that guarantees the tracker is incremented/decremented exactly
//! once per spawn even when the worker's channel send races the main
//! thread's deadline.
