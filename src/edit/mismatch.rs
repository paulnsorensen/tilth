//! Rejection error when a section tag doesn't match live content and recovery
//! failed. Ported from oh-my-pi `packages/hashline/src/mismatch.ts`: two shapes,
//! `Drift` (tag was minted this session but content moved on) vs `Fabricated`
//! (tag never seen — hallucinated or carried over from a prior session).
//!
//! PR2 maps this onto a new `TilthError` variant; PR1 keeps it standalone.
