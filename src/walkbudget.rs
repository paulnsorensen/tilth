//! A ceiling on how many entries one request's walks may visit.
//!
//! A backstop for trees with no ignore file to rescue them. `base_walk_builder` prunes a fixed
//! `SKIP_DIRS` list and does not consult `.gitignore`, deliberately, so gitignored-but-locally-
//! relevant files stay findable. On a normal repo that is a good trade. On a tree with a huge
//! number of untracked files nobody thought to ignore, it means the walk covers the whole disk
//! and runs until the request timeout kills it.
//!
//! A timeout is the least informative way to learn any of that. It arrives after the full wait,
//! says only "too long", and discards whatever the walk had found. This trips first, keeps the
//! partial results, and says what consumed the budget.
//!
//! # Not silent
//!
//! A cap that truncates without saying so turns "I searched everything" into a lie, which is the
//! same defect class as a scope silently widening to the whole checkout. So the trip is recorded
//! and surfaced on the response, together with the directories that consumed the budget — the
//! note is the point, the early exit is just what makes it cheap.
//!
//! # Why a plain global rather than `cancel`'s published-token machinery
//!
//! `cancel` publishes a fresh `Arc` per request and takes care to give each walk the token of the
//! request that built it. That care buys a guarantee this does not need. `CancelToken` documents
//! that its flag "carries no data" and justifies `Relaxed` on exactly that basis; hanging a
//! counter off it would weaken a stated invariant in a module whose header opens by warning how
//! delicate it is.
//!
//! The MCP server handles requests serially, so [`reset`] at the top of a tool call and
//! [`report`] at the bottom bracket exactly one request's walks.
//!
//! An abandoned worker from a timed-out earlier request keeps walking after the next request has
//! taken over the budget. Each walk therefore captures a **generation** at its start and its
//! visits are discarded once that no longer matches.
//!
//! This was first written without the generation, on the reasoning that stale visits "can only
//! push the count up, so the failure mode is a spurious 'incomplete' note". That was wrong in the
//! dangerous direction, and is recorded because the reasoning is tempting:
//! [`WalkBudget::note_visit`] *returns* `true`, which the caller turns into `WalkState::Quit`, so
//! a stale worker did not merely annotate the next request — it cut that request's own walk
//! short and labelled complete results INCOMPLETE. Worse, it was self-reinforcing: the request
//! most likely to leave a worker behind is one that timed out on a pathological tree, which is
//! precisely the worker that then burns the whole ceiling in seconds.
//!
//! # Why the state is a struct and not bare statics
//!
//! The counting lives on [`WalkBudget`] with one process-wide instance, rather than in
//! free-standing statics, so that tests can drive a private instance. Written with statics
//! first, the tests were **flaky**: they asserted exact counter values while the rest of the
//! suite ran real walks into the same global, so a run could report a trip that another test's
//! walk had caused. A test whose verdict depends on what else is running is worse than no test —
//! it teaches you to ignore it.
//!
