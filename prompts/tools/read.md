BATCH every needed file into one `tilth_read` call; `paths` never accepts a singular value. Read known files, symbols, or ranges with smart sizing; DO NOT re-read search-expanded content. Example: `tilth_read(paths: ["src/lib.rs", "src/mcp.rs#tool_search"], cwd: "/abs/repo")`.

Output lines are `N:content`. In edit mode, `[path#TAG]` appears above the numbered lines; copy that TAG and the shown 1-based line numbers into `tilth_write`—NEVER invent either. `mode=stripped` is non-editable.

A leading JSON header may report `if_modified_since`, `view`, `original_line_count`, `next_view`, `lines_stripped`, `truncated`, and `truncated_at_line`. Reuse its timestamp for unchanged stubs; use line counts to report clipped output.
