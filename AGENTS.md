tilth — code intelligence MCP server. Replaces grep, cat, find, ls with AST-aware equivalents.

## Core Principles

ALWAYS BATCH: When you have 2+ files to read, call tilth_read with paths: [...]. When you have edits to multiple files, call tilth_edit with files: [...]. Never make N serial calls when one will do — each tool call is a turn.

Search first: To explore code, always call tilth_search before reaching for other tools. It finds definitions, usages, and file locations in one call.

DO NOT use Grep, Read, or Glob. Use tilth_search (grep), tilth_read (read), tilth_files (glob) instead.
DO NOT use Bash(grep/rg/cat/head/tail/find/ls). Use the tilth tools.
DO NOT re-read files already shown in expanded search results.

## Tools

tilth_search: Code search — finds definitions, usages, and text. Replaces grep/rg.
  Usage: tilth_search(query: "handleRequest")
  For multi-symbol lookup, separate with comma: "symbol1,symbol2" (max 5)
  kind: "symbol" (default) | "content" (strings/comments) | "callers" (call sites)
  expand: (default 2) inline full source for top matches
  context: path to file being edited — boosts nearby results
  glob: file pattern filter — "*.rs" (whitelist), "!*.test.ts" (exclude)
  Output per match:
    ## <path>:<start>-<end> [definition|usage|impl]
    <outline context>
    <expanded source block>
    ── calls ──
    <name>  <path>:<start>-<end>  <signature>
    ── siblings ──
    <name>  <path>:<start>-<end>  <signature>
  Re-expanding a previously shown definition returns [shown earlier].

tilth_read: File reading with smart outlining. Replaces cat/head/tail.
  Usage: tilth_read(path: "a.rs") or tilth_read(paths: ["a.rs", "b.rs"]) (max 20 files in one call)
  Small files return full content. Large files return structural outline.
  section: "<start>-<end>" or "<heading text>" to read a specific slice
  sections: array of ranges/headings for multiple slices from the same file in one call
  Output modes:
    Full/section: <line_number> │ <content>
    Outline: [<start>-<end>]  <symbol name>

tilth_files: File glob search. Replaces find, ls, pwd.
  Usage: tilth_files(patterns: ["*.rs", "*.toml"]) — run multiple globs in one call
  Output: <path>  (~<token_count> tokens)

tilth_deps: Blast-radius check before signature changes.
  Shows what imports this file and what it imports.
  Use ONLY before renaming, removing, or changing an export's signature.

tilth_diff: Structural diff at function level. Replaces Bash(git diff/git log --patch).
  Usage: tilth_diff(source: "HEAD~1") for last commit, or no args for uncommitted changes
  scope: "file.rs" or "file.rs:fn_name" to limit to a specific function
  log: "HEAD~5..HEAD" for per-commit summaries
  search: filter to lines matching a term
  blast: true to show callers of changed function signatures
  Output: [+] added, [-] deleted, [~] body changed, [~:sig] signature changed

tilth_edit: Batch edit files using hash-anchored lines. Replaces the host Edit tool.

ALWAYS group edits to multiple files into ONE tilth_edit call (max 20 files). Never call tilth_edit twice in a row.

Workflow: tilth_read → copy anchors (<line>:<hash>) (BOTH line and hash required) → pass to tilth_edit.
Note: tilth_search does NOT provide hashes — you MUST tilth_read the file or section first to get them.

Request shape:
```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "a.rs",
      "edits": [
        {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "content": "<new code>"},
        {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "end": "<line>:<hash>", "content": "..."},
        {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "content": ""}
      ]
    },
    {"path": "b.rs", "edits": [...]}
  ],
  "diff": true
}
```

Edit forms inside `edits`:
- Single line: {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "content": "<new code>"}
- Range: {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "end": "<line>:<hash>", "content": "..."}
- Delete: {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "content": ""}

Behavior:
- Each file is processed independently. A hash mismatch on one file does NOT block the others.
- Hash mismatch means the file changed after you read it. Re-read THAT file and retry (other files in the batch already applied).
- Large files: tilth_read shows outline — use section to get hashlined content.
- Pass diff: true to see a compact before/after diff per file.
- After editing a function signature, tilth_edit shows callers that may need updating.

DO NOT use the host Edit tool. Use tilth_edit for all edits.
