## Base mode

tilth — code intelligence MCP server. Replaces grep, cat, find, ls, and git diff.
DO NOT use shell for repo files or history (cat/head/tail/sed/grep/rg/ls/find/git diff/git log); use `tilth_read`, `tilth_search`, `tilth_list`, `tilth_diff`. Shell is for tests, builds, and non-file operations.

DO NOT omit `cwd`: set it to the absolute checkout directory on every call. Relative paths/scopes anchor there; absolute paths pass through. The server cannot see your shell cwd; `..` in relative paths is refused.

BATCH related work; array parameters never accept singular values:

- `queries: [{query: "foo"}, {query: "bar", kind: "symbol"}]`
- `paths: ["src/a.rs#12-40", "src/b.rs#parse"]`
- `patterns: ["*.rs", "*.toml"]`

ROUTE:

- Find/explore → `tilth_search`; omitted `kind` merges definitions, usages, and callers; set `kind` (symbol|content|regex|callers) when the shape is known.
- Read known files/symbols/ranges → `tilth_read`.
- Importers/imports → `tilth_deps`; DO NOT assemble it from import-greps or repeated callers searches.
- Understand one symbol → `tilth_grok(target: "parse_diff", cwd: "/abs/repo")`; replaces search → expand → callers.
- Changes → `tilth_diff`, optional `source: "HEAD~1"`.
- Browse without a search term → `tilth_list`; omit `patterns` for a project overview.
DO NOT re-read expanded search content.

## Edit mode

tilth — code intelligence MCP server. Replaces grep, cat, find, ls, git diff, and host edit tools.
DO NOT use shell for repo files or history (cat/head/tail/sed/grep/rg/ls/find/git diff/git log) and DO NOT use host Edit/Write; use tilth tools. Shell is for tests, builds, and non-file operations.

DO NOT omit `cwd`: set it to the absolute checkout directory on every call. Relative paths/scopes anchor there; absolute paths pass through. The server cannot see your shell cwd; `..` in relative paths is refused.

BATCH related work; array parameters never accept singular values:

- `queries: [{query: "foo"}, {query: "bar", kind: "symbol"}]`
- `paths: ["src/a.rs#12-40", "src/b.rs#parse"]`
- `patterns: ["*.rs", "*.toml"]`
- `edits: [{path: "src/a.rs", tag: "1A2B", ops: [...]}, {path: "src/b.rs", tag: "3C4D", ops: [...]}]`

READ BEFORE WRITE: edit-mode `tilth_read` prints `[path#TAG]` above 1-based numbered lines. Copy its TAG and integer line numbers; NEVER invent either. A section read (`path#12-40`) carries the whole-file TAG; edit only lines it showed. `tilth_write` accepts `{path, tag?, ops}` sections. `replace_text` swaps one exact unique `old`; `create_file` seeds a new path; line ops use copied integer `start`/`end`. Omit `tag` only for a new file or one too large to tag. Drift is 3-way-merged; a conflict rejects that section—re-read and retry it. Sections are independent.

JSON string values must escape tabs/newlines as `\t` and `\n`; literal controls break the call before the server receives it.

ROUTE: find/explore → `tilth_search`; read → `tilth_read`; importers/imports → `tilth_deps` (not import-greps); understand one symbol → `tilth_grok` (replaces search → expand → callers); changes → `tilth_diff`; browse → `tilth_list` (omit `patterns` for a project overview); edit → `tilth_write`.
DO NOT re-read expanded search content.

## Search-v2 surfaces

Spliced above the ROUTE line in either mode when `--search-surface v2|both`:

PREFER `tilth_search_v2` for find/explore when advertised: `queries: [{query, glob?}]` (1-10) + `cwd`; follow its `hints`.
