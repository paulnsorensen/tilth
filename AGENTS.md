tilth — code intelligence MCP server. Replaces grep, cat, find, ls with AST-aware equivalents.

To explore code, always search first. tilth_search finds definitions, usages, and file locations in one call.
Usage: tilth_search(query: "handleRequest").
tilth_files is ONLY for listing directory contents when you have no symbol or text to search for.
DO NOT use Read if content is already shown in expanded search results.
DO NOT use Grep, Read, or Glob. Always use the better tools tilth_search (grep), tilth_read (read), tilth_files (glob).

tilth_search: Search code — finds definitions, usages, and text. Replaces grep/rg for all code search.
For multi-symbol lookup, separate each with a comma "symbol1,symbol2" (max 5).
kind: "symbol" (default) | "content" (strings/comments) | "callers" (call sites)
expand (default 2): inline full source for top matches.
context: path to file being edited — boosts nearby results.
glob: file pattern filter — "*.rs" (whitelist), "!*.test.ts" (exclude).
Output per match:
## <path>:<start>-<end> [definition|usage|impl]
<outline context>
<expanded source block>
── calls ──
<name>  <path>:<start>-<end>  <signature>
── siblings ──
<name>  <path>:<start>-<end>  <signature>
Re-expanding a previously shown definition returns [shown earlier].

tilth_read: Read file content with smart outlining. Replaces cat/head/tail.
Small files → full content. Large files → structural outline.
section: "<start>-<end>" or "<heading text>"
sections: array of ranges/headings — multiple slices from the same file in one call.
paths: read multiple files in one call.
Output:
<line_number> │ <content>                  ← full/section mode
[<start>-<end>]  <symbol name>             ← outline mode

tilth_files: Find files by glob pattern. Replaces find, ls, pwd, and the host Glob tool.
patterns: run multiple globs in one call (e.g. patterns: ["*.rs", "*.toml"]).
Output: <path>  (~<token_count> tokens).

tilth_deps: Blast-radius check — what imports this file and what it imports.
Use ONLY before renaming, removing, or changing an export's signature.

tilth_grok: Everything structural about a symbol in one call — def + body + signature + doc + callees + callers + siblings + tests.
Usage: tilth_grok(target: "parse_unified_diff"). Also accepts "src/file.rs:7" or "Type::method".
scope: narrow when the name is ambiguous. full: widen caps from 5/5/8/8 to 50/30/30/30.
Use ONLY for "understand this symbol" questions — replaces the search → expand → callers chain.
DO NOT use for concept search (use tilth_search) or reading file contents (use tilth_read).

tilth_diff: Structural diff — shows what changed at function level. Replaces Bash(git diff).
Usage: tilth_diff(source: "HEAD~1") for last commit. No args = uncommitted changes.
scope: "file.rs" or "file.rs:fn_name". log: "HEAD~5..HEAD" for per-commit summaries.
search: filter to lines matching a term. blast: true to show callers of changed signatures.
Output: [+] added, [-] deleted, [~] body changed, [~:sig] signature changed.
DO NOT use Bash(git diff) or Bash(git log --patch). Use tilth_diff instead.

To search code, use tilth_search instead of Grep or Bash(grep/rg).
To read files, use tilth_read instead of Read or Bash(cat).
To find files, use tilth_files instead of Glob or Bash(find/ls).
To check what changed, use tilth_diff instead of Bash(git diff/git log).
DO NOT re-read files already shown in expanded search results.

tilth_write: Batch write one or more files in one call. Replaces the host Edit and Write tools.
ALWAYS group writes to multiple files into ONE tilth_write call (max 20 files). Never call tilth_write twice in a row.
Modes per file (set via `mode`):

- hash (default): replace lines at hash anchors. tilth_read → copy anchors (<line>:<hash>) (BOTH line and hash required) → pass to tilth_write. tilth_search does NOT provide hashes — you MUST tilth_read the file or section first.
- overwrite: write the file from scratch. Default is **create-only** — an existing file is rejected so you don't clobber by accident. Pass `overwrite: true` to replace an existing file.
- append: append `content` to the file (creates it if absent).

Shape: {"files": [{"path": "a.rs", "mode": "hash", "edits": [...]}, {"path": "b.rs", "mode": "overwrite", "content": "..."}]}
Hash edits: {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "content": "<new code>"} | {"start": "...", "end": "...", "content": "..."} | {"start": "...", "content": ""} to delete.
Overwrite (new file): {"path": "new.rs", "mode": "overwrite", "content": "fn main(){}\n"}
Overwrite (replace existing): {"path": "old.rs", "mode": "overwrite", "overwrite": true, "content": "..."}
Append: {"path": "log.txt", "mode": "append", "content": "...\n"}
overwrite responses echo the full file's hashlines; append echoes only the appended region (header reports `echoing last M of T lines`). Use tilth_read if you need anchors over pre-existing content above the appended block.
Per-file results: each file is processed independently. A hash mismatch on one file does NOT block the others.
isError is false whenever ≥1 file succeeded — always scan the per-file `## <path>` sections for failures rather than trusting the top-level status.
Hash mismatch → file changed, re-read THAT file and retry it (other files in the batch already applied).
A parse error on one edit invalidates ALL edits for that file (none applied); retry the whole file's edits after fixing the malformed entry.
Each file path may appear at most once per call — group all edits for a file under its single entry.
Large files: tilth_read shows outline — use section to get hashlined content.
Pass diff: true to see a compact before/after diff per file.
After editing a function signature, tilth_write shows callers that may need updating.
DO NOT use the host Edit or Write tool. Use tilth_write for all writes.
